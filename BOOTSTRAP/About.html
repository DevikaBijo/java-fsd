    <h2><i><b>About Me</b></i></h2>
    <p><i>Hi everyone!<br>
        Thanks for coming and checking out my blog. I’m Devika!<br>
        
        My two purposes in blog life are to inspire you to travel in a way, and to places,
         you wouldn’t have thought of before.
        And to explore the soul searching, uniting feeling of going to
         festivals around the world to revel in the different culture.</i></p>
    
   
         <h2><i><b>My purpose</b></i></h2>
         <p><i>I used to think I’d do something cool for charity, save the world somehow, in my own little way, but I’ve decided that if I inspire the right person to relax or push out of their comfort zones with my travel writing, then maybe, just maybe, 
            they’ll be the ones to save the world instead, and I’m indirectly responsible</i></p>
